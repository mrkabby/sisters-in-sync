              The term "sis" has been thrown around so loosely that women have
              forgotten how important it is to support one another. **S.I.S.**
              is a re-commitment to sisters truly being one another's
              cheerleaders and confidants.

              The **S.I.S.** network has been crafted for young women between
              the ages of **18-28**. This pivotal age gap is essential for
              establishing one's life. Between these ages, a young lady is no
              longer a child, and she is not quite the woman that she hopes to
              become.

              We have found that this is the prime intersection between
              mentorship and potential, drive and sustainability. So, whether
              you are fresh out of high school and entering college or diving
              into the workforce, **S.I.S. has something for you!**
